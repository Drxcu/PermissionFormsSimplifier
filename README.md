# PermissionFormsSimplifier
A friend asked me to create an application to simplify how they fill out their forms at work, and to make it basically impossible to fill it out incorrectly. This template is right now in use for a multitude of forms, this is just the first one that I created, and I thought I'd add this here in case anyone needs something similar.
I wanted to familiarize myself a little more with python and flask, so together with ChatGPT I spent some days to make this.
